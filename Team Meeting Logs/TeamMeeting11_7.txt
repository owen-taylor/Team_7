Decsisions Made:
-We are moving forward with the interactive map. I should give us more freedom in the future to add features.
      -Alternative option was to continue using static maps. There is no real upside to this except for cost(but we do so little calls it doesn't matter)
-Storing locations using longitude and latitude
      -May end up using "what three words" api to make user input of location easier.
-Displaying Instructions and user information on the homepage.
-Adding spots to the database will be done using a modal.
