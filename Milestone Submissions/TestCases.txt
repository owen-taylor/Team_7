Test with Sarah:
Feature 1: Everything working as planned
Feature 2: Everything working as planned
Feature 3: Sarah could not find the button to bring back the side navigation bar - color blended in with the map. The website has been changed accordingly.

Test with Evan's parents:
Feature 1: They could log in after they created an account, so everything worked there
Feature 2: They could not find the register page. I changed the website since then to just include a register tab instead of only having the link from the login page.
Feature 3: Almost everything worked, except they were able to make a spot with no name on it. This has been fixed now
